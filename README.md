### How to install this

1. In Chrome, open the `Bookmarks Manager`
* Right-click on the `Bookmarks Bar` folder
* `Add Page...` 
	* `Name` can be whatever you like, e.g. `GitHub.print`
	* `URL`: copy-paste all the JS code in [bookmarklet.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeAndCake/github.print/master/bookmarklet.js)

You will then have a `GitHub.print` button in your Bookmarks bar. 

### How to use this

Go to a GitHub page with Markdown content, typically a `README.md` page and click the `GitHub.print` button.
